# AI-Human Project Journal


- Added a detailed MVP 2 implementation plan (LLM batch processing, no clarification loop) to implementation_plan.md, including goal, checklist, AI suggestions, and progress tracking.
- Completed MVP 1 (core batch note interpreter): all tests pass, the pipeline works end-to-end, and documentation/examples are in place.
- Verified that all main documentation files (system overview, technical spec, functional spec, implementation plan) are consistent and aligned with the latest requirements (metadata fields, output format, batch agent, etc.).
- Decided to keep a running journal of project iterations and key decisions, with newest entries at the top, and to use a '- now [date]' marker for each day's records.
- Added detailed MVP milestones to the implementation plan for incremental delivery and validation.
- Established a clear, testable roadmap for the project with milestone-based MVPs.
- Restored and improved the technical specification, clarifying the batch-oriented LLM agent design and class structure.
- Renamed and reorganized documentation files for clarity and consistency.
