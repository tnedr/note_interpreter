# AI-Human Project Journal

- Verified that all main documentation files (system overview, technical spec, functional spec, implementation plan) are consistent and aligned with the latest requirements (metadata fields, output format, batch agent, etc.).
- Decided to keep a running journal of project iterations and key decisions, with newest entries at the top, and to use a '- now [date]' marker for each day's records.
- Added detailed MVP milestones to the implementation plan for incremental delivery and validation.
- Established a clear, testable roadmap for the project with milestone-based MVPs.
- Restored and improved the technical specification, clarifying the batch-oriented LLM agent design and class structure.
- Renamed and reorganized documentation files for clarity and consistency.
