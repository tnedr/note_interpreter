Whenever a significant event, decision, or observation occurs during the project (including code changes, design discussions, or process updates), the AI assistant must append a brief summary of the event to the top of aihuman_journal/journal.md, using the following format:
All entries for a given day are grouped together, with the marker - now [YYYY-MM-DD] at the bottom of the day's block.
New entries are always added above the most recent date marker, so the most recent events are at the top of the file.
When a new day starts, a new - now [YYYY-MM-DD] marker is added at the bottom of the new day's block.

Example:
# AI-Human Project Journal

- Fixed a bug in the InputHandler.
- Decided to start implementing MVP 1.
- now 2025-05-18

- Added detailed MVP milestones to the implementation plan for incremental delivery and validation.
- now 2025-05-17


Guidelines:
Each entry should be a single, clear sentence describing what happened or was decided.
The journal should be updated after every major step, milestone, or important discussion.
The format must be strictly followed to ensure chronological clarity and easy review.
