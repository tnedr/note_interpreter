# PROMPT CONFIG STRUCTURE (for human readers only)
#
# This config controls the order, inclusion, and customization of prompt sections for the AI note interpreter agent.
#
# Prompt Sections (in order):
#   - intro: System introduction and agent persona
#   - goals: What the agent must achieve
#   - output_schema_and_meanings: Unified output schema and field meanings (from YAML)
#   - classification: Allowed entity types and intents (from YAML)
#   - scoring_guidelines: Note scoring/clarification triggers
#   - parameter_explanations: Agent parameters and thresholds
#   - output_validation_rules: Output requirements and constraints
#   - tool_json_schema: JSON schema for the main tool
#   - tool_behavior_summary: How/when to use tools
#   - context_usage: How to use memory and context
#   - clarification_protocol: When/how to ask for clarification
#   - memory_update: How to update long-term memory
#   - memory_point_examples: Examples of memory points
#   - example_output: Example of a valid output
#   - input_context: The actual notes, memory, and clarification Q&A
#   - finalization_protocol: When/how to finalize output
#   - custom_section: (Optional) Any custom text you want
#
# Tools available to the agent:
#   - ask_user: Used to ask the user clarification questions if the agent is uncertain.
#   - finalize_notes: Used to return the final, structured, enriched output (entries, new_memory_points, ask_user_questions).
