1. Overview
In large language model (LLM)–driven systems—especially those using prompt-based agents—it is crucial to ensure that changes to prompts, parameters, or LLM versions do not unintentionally degrade system behavior. This is especially true in structured multi-agent pipelines like the note clarification system, where output quality and consistency are essential for downstream interpretation, enrichment, and memory embedding.

A regression harness is a structured testing framework that guarantees prompt behavior remains stable and predictable over time.

2. Purpose
The regression harness serves as a safety mechanism for:

Prompt refactoring or optimization

LLM upgrades (e.g., GPT-4 → GPT-4o)

Iterative prompt tuning based on user feedback or metrics

Avoiding silent degradation of system quality

Preserving agent contract behavior

3. Key Features of a Prompt Regression Harness
Feature	Description
Snapshot testing	Stores expected input-output pairs for comparison during future runs
Precision diffs	Highlights exactly which fields changed between runs
Score drift tracking	Allows small variance (e.g., ±5) but flags larger or logic-breaking changes
Model-neutral evaluation	Can compare outputs across LLMs using the same prompt
Human-in-the-loop reviews	Optional LLM judge or developer review when exact matching fails

4. Components
4.1. Input Fixtures
Each test consists of a structured input payload. Example (for ClarifyAndScoreAgent):

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "id": "note_01",
  "raw_text": "email Sarah",
  "clarification_history": [],
  "long_term_memory": [
    "Sarah is Tamas's assistant",
    "Emails usually refer to Monday follow-up"
  ]
}
4.2. Expected Output Snapshots
Expected agent response based on the prompt and current model behavior:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "clarified_text": "Send a follow-up email to Sarah about the Monday meeting",
  "clarity_score": 90,
  "new_questions": []
}
These are saved in files and version-controlled.

4.3. Comparison Logic
The regression harness runs the agent on the saved input, collects the actual output, and performs field-by-field comparison against the expected output.

Example:
diff
Copy
Edit
- "clarified_text": "Send a follow-up email to Sarah about the Monday meeting"
+ "clarified_text": "Email Sarah to follow up on the meeting from Monday"
This triggers a soft or hard test failure depending on config.

5. Folder Structure Example
pgsql
Copy
Edit
regression_tests/
├── clarify_and_score/
│   ├── test_001_input.json
│   ├── test_001_expected_output.json
│   ├── test_002_input.json
│   └── test_002_expected_output.json
6. Test Runner Architecture
You can use Python + Pytest, or integrate it with LangChain, Make.com, or CI/CD pipelines.

Example (Python):
python
Copy
Edit
def test_regression_case_001():
    input_data = json.load(open("test_001_input.json"))
    expected_output = json.load(open("test_001_expected_output.json"))

    actual_output = run_clarify_and_score_agent(input_data)

    assert actual_output == expected_output
You can extend it with:

assert actual_output['clarity_score'] in range(85, 95)

assert_diff_field_only("clarified_text")

llm_judge_evaluation(expected, actual)

7. Typical Use Cases
Use Case	Benefit
Prompt refactoring	Detect if a rewrite accidentally reduces quality
Model upgrade testing	Evaluate GPT-4 vs GPT-4o on same cases
New memory format integration	Ensure new memory structure doesn’t break old logic
Edge-case hardening	Ensure previously fixed bugs don’t reappear (e.g., “budget numbers”)

8. Optional Enhancements
Feature	Description
🧠 LLM-as-Judge	Use GPT to evaluate if the clarified text is still “valid” after changes
📊 Score Tolerance Config	Allow ±X score deviation, flag larger shifts
🧪 Prompt Ablation Tests	Systematically test prompt variants for fragility
📋 Failure Categorization	Track whether failure was format error, logic drift, hallucination
📈 Drift Metrics Dashboard	Visual report: how output quality changes over time

9. Benefits of a Regression Harness
Benefit	Why It Matters
Stability	Prevents bugs or prompt regressions from reaching production
Confidence	Enables safe prompt and architecture iteration
Traceability	Prompts and behavior are version-controlled and auditable
Testability	Makes LLM agents compatible with traditional software engineering practices

10. Recommended Workflow
Create 5–10 representative test cases for each agent (ClarifyAndScoreAgent, etc.)

Save their expected outputs in regression_tests/

Set up pytest or a Make.com workflow to run tests on every change

Run tests after:

Prompt edits

Model version changes

Memory format adjustments

Review and approve changes using diff summaries or LLM evaluation

Update test snapshots when new outputs are validated

11. Summary
A regression harness in prompt-based AI systems ensures your agents behave consistently and reliably over time. It enables high-quality, testable, maintainable prompt engineering and prevents silent degradation of performance due to subtle prompt or model changes.

It should be a core component of any production-level multi-agent architecture.
