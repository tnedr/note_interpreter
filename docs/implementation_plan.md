# ðŸš€ Implementation Plan

## MVP Milestones

### MVP 1: Core Batch Note Interpreter (No LLM, No Clarification)
- **Goal:** Prove the data pipeline, file I/O, and data models work.
- **Features:**
  - Read notes from CSV, user memory from Markdown, and classification config from YAML.
  - Output a CSV with the same notes, but with placeholder fields for scores, interpretation, and metadata.
- **Why:** Ensures your data flow and file handling are robust before adding LLM complexity.

## MVP 1 Implementation Plan

### Goal
Prove the data pipeline, file I/O, and data models work (no LLM, no clarification logic).

### Task Checklist
- [x] Define `Note` and `NoteBatch` classes using `pydantic` for validation.
- [x] Add serialization/deserialization methods for `Note` (from/to CSV row).
- [x] Implement `InputHandler` to read notes from CSV, user memory from Markdown, and classification config from YAML.
- [x] Implement `OutputGenerator` to write a batch of notes to CSV with placeholder fields for scores, interpretation, and metadata.
- [x] Write unit tests for data models and file I/O.
- [x] Write an integration test for the full pipeline (read input â†’ process â†’ write output).
- [x] Add example input files to `docs/examples/`.
- [x] Document how to run the MVP 1 pipeline and tests in the `README.md`.

### AI Suggestions
- Use test-driven development: write or update tests before implementing each feature.
- Keep each function/class small and focused for easier testing and debugging.
- Automate test runs with a script or CI (e.g., GitHub Actions).
- Log each major step or decision in `aihuman_journal/journal.md`.

### MVP 2: LLM Batch Processing (No Clarification Loop)
- **Goal:** Integrate the LLM agent for batch processing of notes.
- **Features:**
  - LLM agent processes a batch of notes and user memory, returning scores, interpretation, and metadata for each note.
  - Output enriched CSV.
  - No clarification questions yetâ€”just one-shot processing.
- **Why:** Validates LLM integration, prompt design, and output parsing.

### MVP 2 Implementation Plan: LLM Batch Processing (No Clarification Loop)

#### Goal
Integrate the LLM agent for batch processing of notes, producing enriched output (scores, interpretation, metadata) for each note in a single pass, without clarification questions.

#### Approach & Constraints
- The agent will be implemented using **LangChain** for modularity, memory/context management, and easy LLM integration.
- **Function-calling/tool usage** will be used to ensure structured output (scores, interpretation, metadata) from the LLM, reducing parsing errors and ambiguity.
- Only a restricted set of LLMs (e.g., OpenAI GPT-4, some Azure/OpenAI endpoints) currently support function-calling; this constrains model selection, but the LLM should be replaceable/configurable.
- LangChain's memory features may be used to inject user memory/context into each batch.

#### Task Checklist
- [ ] Design and document the LLM prompt template for batch note processing (input: notes, user memory, classification config).
- [ ] Define the function/tool schema for structured output (input/output signature for enrichment tool).
- [ ] Implement the `LLMAgent` class as a LangChain agent with function/tool usage for structured output.
- [ ] Integrate LLM API (OpenAI, Azure, or other function-calling-capable model) for batch processing.
- [ ] Implement output parsing and validation (scores, interpretation, metadata) from LLM responses.
- [ ] Update the pipeline to use the LangChain-based LLM agent for batch processing.
- [ ] Write unit tests for the LLM agent and output parsing logic.
- [ ] Write an integration test for the full pipeline (input â†’ LLM agent â†’ output).
- [ ] Add example LLM prompt/response schemas and function/tool definitions to the docs.
- [ ] Update the `README.md` with instructions for running the MVP 2 pipeline.

#### AI Suggestions
- Start with a simple, robust prompt template; iterate based on test results.
- Use mock LLM responses for initial testing to decouple prompt design from API integration.
- Validate all LLM outputs against the classification config and required fields.
- Log all LLM requests and responses for debugging and traceability.
- Continue to log all major steps and decisions in `aihuman_journal/journal.md`.

### MVP 3: Clarification Loop
- **Goal:** Add the clarification loop for ambiguous notes.
- **Features:**
  - Detect notes needing clarification (based on scores).
  - Present clarification questions to the user, collect answers, and re-run the LLM agent.
  - Limit to 2 clarification rounds per note.
- **Why:** Demonstrates the full "human-in-the-loop" workflow and resolves ambiguity.

### MVP 4: Validation, Logging, and Error Handling
- **Goal:** Harden the system for real-world use.
- **Features:**
  - Validate all outputs, flag unresolved notes, and check metadata against config.
  - Add structured logging and error handling for LLM/API/file issues.
- **Why:** Ensures reliability and traceability.

### MVP 5: CLI Interface and Documentation
- **Goal:** Make the system usable by others.
- **Features:**
  - Command-line interface for running the pipeline.
  - Usage instructions and example files in the docs.
- **Why:** Enables real users to try the system and provide feedback.

### MVP 6: (Optional) Minimal Web UI
- **Goal:** Provide a simple web interface for batch uploads and clarification dialogs.
- **Features:**
  - Web form for uploading files and answering clarifications.
- **Why:** Lowers the barrier for non-technical users.
