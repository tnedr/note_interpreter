# Functional Specification – Prompt Lab

This document defines the functional requirements and supported workflows of the **Prompt Lab** system itself. It does **not** specify the logic or requirements of the agents being tested, but rather what the lab as a meta-tool must provide for prompt/agent development, testing, and regression.

---

## 1. Purpose

Prompt Lab is a modular, extensible environment for:
- Developing, versioning, and maintaining prompts for LLM-based agents.
- Testing prompt behavior with realistic, versioned input scenarios.
- Automating regression testing and output comparison across prompt versions.
- Supporting stepwise, multi-turn agent prompt pipelines (clarification, memory, etc.).
- Enabling prompt engineering as a disciplined, test-driven process.

---

## 2. Main User Stories / Use Cases

- **Prompt Engineer:**
  - Can create, edit, and version prompt YAMLs for any agent.
  - Can define and run test cases (input + expected output) for any prompt version.
  - Can compare outputs across prompt versions to detect regressions or improvements.
  - Can view logs, diffs, and regression reports for all test runs.
  - Can add new agents, prompt pipelines, or test scenarios without changing core lab code.

- **Researcher/Team Lead:**
  - Can audit the evolution of prompts and agent behavior over time.
  - Can ensure that all prompt changes are regression-tested before deployment.

- **CI/CD Pipeline:**
  - Can run all prompt regression tests automatically and report failures.

## 3. Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Prompt Management
- Store prompt templates in versioned YAML files, organized by agent and version.
- Support arbitrary prompt structure (section-based, multi-turn, etc.).
- Allow prompt metadata (description, changelog, test coverage) alongside each version.

### 3.2 Test Case Management
- Store test cases as YAML/JSON files, each with input and expected output.
- Support both single-turn and multi-turn (clarification loop) scenarios.
- Allow test cases to be reused across prompt versions.

### 3.3 Test Execution & Evaluation
- Run all test cases against all relevant prompt versions.
- Log all outputs, including raw LLM output, diffs, and pass/fail status.
- Support both automated (assert-based) and manual (human-in-the-loop) evaluation.
- Allow for regression detection: highlight when a new prompt version fails a previously passing test.

### 3.4 Results & Reporting
- Store all test run results, logs, and diffs in a structured, timestamped way.
- Provide summary reports of test coverage, regressions, and prompt evolution.

### 3.5 Extensibility & Modularity
- New agents, prompt pipelines, or test scenarios can be added by creating new files/folders, not by editing core code.
- Core logic (PromptBuilder, AgentCore, test runner) is reusable and agent-agnostic.
- Support for multiple LLM providers and test runners (Promptfoo, LangSmith, etc.).

---

## 4. Supported Workflows

- **Stepwise Prompt Development:**
  - Add new prompt version → Add/modify test cases → Run tests → Review results → Iterate.
- **Regression Testing:**
  - Run all tests on all prompt versions before merging/deploying changes.
- **Prompt Comparison:**
  - Compare outputs and diffs between prompt versions for the same test cases.
- **Multi-agent Support:**
  - Add new agent folders with their own prompts and test cases.

---

## 5. Boundaries / Out of Scope

- The lab does **not** define or constrain the internal logic of the agents being tested.
- The lab does **not** provide a UI (CLI/scripts only, unless extended).
- The lab does **not** manage LLM API keys or user authentication.
- The lab does **not** enforce a specific prompt schema, but provides best practices and validation tools.
