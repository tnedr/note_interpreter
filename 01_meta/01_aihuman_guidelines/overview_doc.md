# Best Practice: Writing Effective overview.md Files

## Purpose
This document provides guidelines for creating clear, useful `overview.md` files in any project folder. A well-structured overview.md helps both humans and AI agents understand the folder's role, contents, and usage.

## Recommended Sections
- **Purpose:** Why does this folder exist? What is its main goal?
- **Context:** How does this folder relate to the rest of the project? What workflows or dependencies are relevant?
- **Usage:** How should this folder be used? Are there naming conventions, contribution rules, or special instructions?
- **File Index:** (Optionally auto-generated) List and briefly describe all files and subfolders.
- **Workflow/Examples:** Typical use cases, best practices, or example scenarios.
- **History/Changelog:** (Optional) Major changes, milestones, or version notes.

## Rationale
- A single, well-structured overview.md makes onboarding, navigation, and AI collaboration easier.
- Keeps all relevant information in one place, reducing confusion and duplication.
